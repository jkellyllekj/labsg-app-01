AGENT BRIEF (DOCS ONLY)

TASK
Add an explicit project rule to project-state.md:
"The assistant must always give explicit instructions (what/where/how), start-to-finish, with copy-paste blocks."

Scope:
- docs only
- edit project-state.md only
- do NOT touch index.js or styles.css
- do NOT reformat or rewrite other sections
- add the smallest possible text block

Commit message:
Docs: enforce explicit instruction style

FILE
project-state.md

WHERE TO ADD
In project-state.md, locate the section:

============================================================================
READ THIS FIRST
============================================================================

Immediately AFTER the existing paragraph that ends with:
"Chat memory is disposable. This file is not."

Add the block below on its own lines, keeping the same plain formatting style.

TEXT TO INSERT (COPY/PASTE EXACTLY)

============================================================================
INSTRUCTION STYLE RULE
============================================================================

The assistant must always provide explicit, start-to-finish instructions.

This means:
- Always specify the exact file name(s)
- Always specify exactly where to change the file (section/heading and position)
- Always provide copy/paste-ready text blocks for additions or replacements
- Do not say "add this somewhere" or "put this in the project state" without exact placement
- Planning happens in chat. The agent is execution-only.

END INSERT

SAVE CHECK
- Confirm no other content changed
- Confirm the new section appears under READ THIS FIRST and before CURRENT PHASE

COMMIT
- Commit only project-state.md
- Commit message exactly:
Docs: enforce explicit instruction style

REPORT BACK
Reply with:
- Confirmation you inserted the block under READ THIS FIRST
- The line or snippet directly above and below the inserted block (2-3 lines each) to prove placement
