Task: Keep clear glass panel but improve text legibility, fix dolphin position and spin direction, move background button to title row with a picture icon, and reduce outer margins by ~10px. index.js only. Minimal changes.

1) Text legibility on glass panel: add “frost chips” behind text and controls

Current issue: clear glass looks great but text disappears on dark backgrounds.

Fix: keep panel background transparent, but give key text areas a subtle frosted pill background.

In the Swim Gen panel HTML:

A) Wrap the title text Swim Gen in a span and add class glassChip.

Example:

<h3 ...><span class="glassChip">Swim Gen</span></h3>


B) Wrap the distance label 1500 (m or yd) in a span with class glassChip.

Example:

<div ...><span class="glassChip"><strong id="distanceLabel">1500</strong> <span>(m or yd)</span></span></div>


C) Apply the same glassChip class to the pool buttons and Generate button in their default state.

Add this CSS:

.glassChip {
  display:inline-block;
  padding: 4px 10px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.22);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.28);
  box-shadow: 0 6px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.10);
}

.glassChipStrong {
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.38);
  border-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.40);
}


Then adjust button CSS so unselected buttons look slightly frosted, selected is fully white:

/* default buttons */
#poolButtonsRow button {
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.18);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.30);
  color: #111;
  font-weight: 600;
}

/* selected button */
#poolButtonsRow button.active {
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.92);
  border-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.55);
  color: #111;
  font-weight: 800;
}


Also bump title weight slightly:

#homePanelTitle { font-weight: 900; }


If you do not have an id, apply it to the h3 in the Swim Gen panel.

2) Dolphin: move to Advanced options line, lower it, spin counter clockwise slower, splash at same spot

A) Place the dolphin span on the same line as Advanced options, at the right side of that row.

Advanced options row should be a flex row:

<div id="advancedRow" style="display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:space-between;">
  <div>▶ Advanced options</div>
  <span id="dolphinLoader" style="display:inline-block; font-size:40px; line-height:1;">🐬</span>
</div>


Remove the dolphin from anywhere else. There must only be one dolphinLoader.

B) Spin direction and speed

Replace the spin keyframes with counter clockwise and slower:

@keyframes dolphinSpin {
  from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  to { transform: rotate(-360deg); }
}

.dolphinSpin {
  display:inline-block;
  animation: dolphinSpin 1500ms linear infinite;
}


C) Splash appears in place

In the finish logic, do not move positions. Just swap text content to 💦 for 250ms then return to 🐬.

3) Background button: move next to “Swim Gen” and use a picture icon

A) Remove the background button from wherever it currently lives (it appears below the panel currently).

B) Put it next to the title on the title row, immediately right of “Swim Gen”.

Use a picture icon. If no icon library is available, use the unicode framed picture:

🖼️

Example HTML:

<div style="display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:space-between;">
  <div style="display:flex; align-items:center; gap:10px;">
    <h3 style="margin:0;"><span class="glassChip">Swim Gen</span></h3>

    <button id="bgCycleBtn" type="button"
      aria-label="Change background"
      style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.20); border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.28); border-radius:12px; padding:4px 8px; cursor:pointer;">
      🖼️
    </button>
  </div>

  <a href="/viewport-lab" style="font-size:12px; opacity:0.25; text-decoration:none; color:#111;">VO</a>
</div>


Important: The click handler already exists and should keep working.

4) Reduce outer margins around panels by about 10px

Find the outer container that sets the page side padding. It will look like:

padding: 32px; or similar on the main wrapper.

Reduce it by 10px. Example:

32px becomes 22px

28px becomes 18px

24px becomes 14px

Do this consistently for:

the top ad placeholder container

the Swim Gen panel container

the results list container

Goal: reclaim horizontal real estate on phones.

5) Keep the glass reflection and slightly increase the twinkle

Keep your current glass overlay, but slightly increase reflection strength:

In the ::before gradient, raise the first stop alpha a bit:

from 0.28 to 0.34

Do not add more blur.

Summary of what this achieves

Glass panel stays clear, but text and buttons become readable on both dark and bright backgrounds due to subtle frosted chips.

Dolphin is lower, aligned to Advanced options, spins counter clockwise slower, splashes in place.

Background icon moves to where it belongs, right next to Swim Gen, and works without generating.

Side gutters shrink so phone layouts feel less cramped.

Reflection is a touch stronger so the glass still “pops”.
