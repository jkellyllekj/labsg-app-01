TASK: FIX DRILL CARD DISTANCE BADGE MISCALCULATION (IGNORE NUMBERED DRILL LIST LINES)
Bug:
Drill cards that include numbered drill items containing numbers (example: "1. 25 Drill / 25 Swim") are causing the distance badge to show an incorrect total (example: 2x50 = 100, badge shows 125).

Goal:
The distance badge displayed for a set must equal the actual set distance defined by the set body.
Numbered drill list lines must NOT contribute to the computed distance for display.

Requirements:
- Do NOT change workout generation logic.
- Only change how the UI computes the displayed distance badge number.
- Do NOT add dependencies.

Implementation guidance:
1) In index.js, locate the function that computes the distance shown on the right side of each card (the blue distance number).
   It is likely parsing the set body text to get a total.

2) Replace or adjust that calculation so it uses these rules when summing body lines:
   - If a line matches NxD at the start (example: "2x50 ..."), add reps*dist.
   - Else if a line matches a single distance format at the start (example: "300 easy"), add that distance.
   - Else if a line is a numbered drill list item (example: "1. 25 Drill / 25 Swim" or "2. 3-3-3"), ignore it completely.
     Rule: ignore any line that matches /^\d+\.\s+/
   - Ignore blank lines.

3) Ensure the drill example below displays 100m, not 125m:
   Body:
   "2x50 Drill FC
    1. 25 Drill / 25 Swim
    2. 3-3-3"
   Expected badge distance: 100

4) Run the app and generate multiple workouts until you see at least one drill set containing "25 Drill / 25 Swim".
   Confirm the badge equals the NxD computed total and no longer adds the embedded 25.

REPORTING
After completing the task, respond with:
1) File changed
2) The exact function name or section where the distance badge calculation lives and what you changed
3) One before/after example showing the drill set body and the badge distance
4) Confirm no other files modified

STOP after this work is done.
