BUG STILL PRESENT
First click fades to fallback aqua and stays. Second click fades in next image. This implies:
- layers not visible due to stacking/opaque wrapper, OR
- background still applied to body, OR
- toLayer is underneath and not visible.

GOAL
One click must crossfade immediately with no fallback colour visible.

MINIMAL FIX (index.js only). Do NOT test.

1) ENFORCE LAYER STACKING (CSS)
Add/ensure these exact rules:

#bgWrap {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 0;           /* behind app, above body */
  pointer-events: none;
}

#bgA, #bgB {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 260ms ease;
  will-change: opacity;
}

/* Explicit stack so the "to" layer can appear above "from" during overlap */
#bgA { z-index: 1; }
#bgB { z-index: 2; }

.isActive { opacity: 1; }

2) ENSURE APP CONTENT IS ABOVE BACKGROUND AND TRANSPARENT (CSS)
Find the main app wrapper/container (whatever holds your cards + controls).
Add/ensure:

#app, .app, .container (use the real selector you have) {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  background: transparent;
}

Also remove/override any solid background colour on that wrapper (the aqua is likely coming from here).

3) STOP USING BODY BACKGROUND ON CYCLE (JS)
Search for any code that sets:
document.body.style.backgroundImage = ...
or BG_TARGET.style.backgroundImage = ...

If your bg layers exist (bgA/bgB), do not set body backgroundImage at all during cycling.
Only set images on bgA/bgB.

4) INIT MUST MAKE ONE LAYER ACTIVE (JS)
Ensure initBackgroundLayers() sets bgA active and bgB inactive:

function initBackgroundLayers() {
  const bgA = document.getElementById("bgA");
  const bgB = document.getElementById("bgB");
  if (!bgA || !bgB) return;

  const url = backgroundImages[bgIndex];
  bgA.style.backgroundImage = `url(${url})`;

  bgA.classList.add("isActive");
  bgB.classList.remove("isActive");

  activeBgLayer = "A";
}

Call initBackgroundLayers() once after bgWrap/bgA/bgB are inserted into DOM.

5) CROSSFADE MUST BRING NEW LAYER ABOVE OLD DURING OVERLAP (JS)
In cycleBackgroundManually():
- After preload:
  - Set the NEXT image on the layer that has the HIGHER z-index during the transition.
Simplest: always fade in bgB then swap, then fade in bgA next time by swapping z-index.

Minimal approach:
- Keep bgB always above bgA via CSS z-index as above.
- During transition:
  - set image on bgB, set bgB active (old stays active), after 280ms remove old active.
  - Then swap roles by sw
