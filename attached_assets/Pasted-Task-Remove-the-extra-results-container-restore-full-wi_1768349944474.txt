Task: Remove the extra results container, restore full width set cards, keep Swim Gen panel frosted, fix dolphin alignment, remove “Generating…” text, and lighten Generate button. index.js only. Minimal diffs.
File: index.js
 Edits are in __START_ROUTE_HOME_UI_HTML_R110__ and the related CSS in the same route.
Change 1, remove the extra panel below the Swim Gen panel (results outer wrapper)
Find the results wrapper div that currently has padding, border, background or rounded corners, something like:
<div id="resultWrap" style="... padding:14px; background:rgba(...); border-radius:...; border:...; box-shadow:...;">

Replace its style so it becomes effectively invisible and does not consume width or add side gutters:
<div id="resultWrap" style="margin-top:16px; padding:0; background:transparent; border-radius:0; border:none; box-shadow:none;">

Do not change the inner set cards. This removes the new container panel entirely.
Change 2, ensure the set cards area is full width like before
There is an outer results container below the input card that currently limits width or adds side padding, something like:
<div style="max-width:520px; box-sizing:border-box;">

Change that outer container to:
<div style="max-width:520px; box-sizing:border-box; padding:0;">

And make sure there is no additional wrapper adding left or right padding around the set cards list.
Goal: set cards go to the same width they used to, without a big translucent panel behind them.
Change 3, remove the “Generating…” text and keep dolphin on the same baseline as the Generate button
Find the element that prints “Generating…” (likely a span or div). It will contain the literal text:
Generating...

Delete that element entirely.
Now ensure dolphin is placed on the Generate row, immediately after the Generate button:
<span id="dolphinLoader" style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:12px;"></span>

Important: the dolphin must not be in the slider row or pool button row.
This keeps its start height and splash position consistent.
Change 4, lighten the Generate button style, do not use solid black
Find the Generate button inline style. It currently renders black.
Change its colours to a frosted pill style:
background: rgba(255,255,255,0.35)


border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.45)


text: #111


If it has box shadow, keep it subtle.
Example replacement style string for the Generate button:
background: rgba(255,255,255,0.35);
border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.45);
color: #111;

Change 5, keep the Swim Gen input card frosted, but make it feel like glass
On the main input card wrapper (the one containing Swim Gen, slider, pool buttons, advanced options, generate button), set:
background: rgba(255,255,255,0.35);
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.30);
box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.18);

Do not increase padding or add side margins.
This keeps the good frosted look but reads more like glass.

Notes so you do not over edit
Do not add any container around the sets.


Do not change the set card layout or spacing.


Do not change generation logic.


Only move dolphin and remove generating text.


Keep VO link as it is.





Message to Replit
Task: Put Generate on same row as pool buttons and change dolphin behaviour to a simple spinner anchored next to Advanced options. Remove separate Generate row. index.js only. Minimal changes.
File: index.js
 Edits are in __START_ROUTE_HOME_UI_HTML_R110__ and the small dolphin animation helper JS in the same route.
1) Move Generate onto the pool button row
Find the pool buttons row block that contains the three buttons:
25m


50m


25yd


Append the Generate button as the fourth item on the same row, with the same height as the buttons.
Example end state in HTML:
<div id="poolButtonsRow" style="display:flex; align-items:center; gap:10px; flex-wrap:wrap;">
  <div id="poolButtons" style="display:flex; gap:8px; flex-wrap:wrap;">
    <button type="button" data-pool="25m" ...>25m</button>
    <button type="button" data-pool="50m" ...>50m</button>
    <button type="button" data-pool="25yd" ...>25yd</button>
  </div>

  <button id="generateBtn" type="button" style="padding:6px 14px; border-radius:8px; cursor:pointer;">
    Generate
  </button>
</div>

Do not leave the old separate Generate row below. Delete it.
2) Dolphin placement: put dolphin to the right of Advanced options label
In the Advanced options line, place a small span immediately after the text:
<span id="dolphinLoader" style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px;"></span>

This is the permanent anchor position for the dolphin.
3) Dolphin behaviour change: stop jump animation, use spin + splash near anchor
Find the JS that currently animates the dolphin jump and splash. It likely sets the dolphin’s position relative to its container and applies a jump path.
Replace that behaviour with a simple loader animation:
When generation starts:


Set #dolphinLoader content to a rotating dolphin emoji (or small inline element) and keep it in place.


When generation ends:


Briefly show a splash emoji once, then clear.


Pseudo behaviour:
start: 🐬 with CSS rotation class


finish: swap to 💦 for 300ms then clear


Implement with a tiny CSS rule:
@keyframes dolphinSpin { from { transform: rotate(0deg); } to { transform: rotate(360deg); } }
.dolphinSpin { display:inline-block; animation: dolphinSpin 700ms linear infinite; }

And minimal JS:
start: dolphinLoader.textContent = "🐬"; dolphinLoader.classList.add("dolphinSpin");


end: remove spin class, set textContent to "💦" for 300ms, then clear.


Do not attempt to compute positions. No absolute positioning. The anchor should never move.
4) Remove “Generating…” text if it still exists
Delete the element containing “Generating…”.
