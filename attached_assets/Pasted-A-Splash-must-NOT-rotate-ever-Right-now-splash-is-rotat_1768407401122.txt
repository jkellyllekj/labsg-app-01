A) Splash must NOT rotate, ever

Right now splash is rotating because it is inheriting either:

the dolphin spin class, or

the same animation restart logic, or

a transform that includes rotate.

Agent instructions

Files: styles.css and index.js
Smallest change.

In styles.css, force splash to never animate:

.splash {
  animation: none !important;
}


Also force splash transform to never include rotate. Set the default:

.splash {
  transform: scale(0.75) rotate(-130deg);
  transition: opacity 0.2s ease, transform 0.2s ease;
}


In index.js, in the dolphin helper, make sure any “force animation restart” function is applied only to the dolphin element, not splash.

If you have code like restartAnim(dolphinEl); restartAnim(splashEl); remove the splash call.

If you set el.style.animation = ... do not do that for splash at all.

In the “show splash” moment, set transform with rotate fixed:

splashEl.style.opacity = "1";
splashEl.style.transform = "scale(0.75) rotate(-130deg)";
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  splashEl.style.transform = "scale(1) rotate(-130deg)";
});


That eliminates spin and locks angle.

B) Splash must be visible BEFORE the page slides down

Right now the scroll happens at the same moment splash appears, so you never see it.

Agent instructions

File: index.js

Find where you trigger the scroll or reveal of the generated set.

Change it so the order is:

dolphin loop finishes

dolphin fades out (0.2s)

splash fades/grows in (0.2s)

wait 150ms so splash is clearly visible

then smooth scroll down

then after generation display update, shrink dolphin back

Implementation pattern:

Move scroll call into the splash shown callback, but delay it.

Example:

onSplashShown: () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    scrollGeneratedIntoViewSmooth();
  }, 150);
}


If you also reveal the generated section via opacity, trigger that at the same time as scroll, not earlier.

C) After generation completes, Generate dolphin must return to big idle size

You said it becomes small after generation. That means the code is swapping to a “small dolphin” class or using the generic class.

Agent instructions

File: index.js

Wherever you reset the Generate button dolphin at the end of the animation, ensure it always ends with the big class:

If you are using:

dolphinIcon for normal

dolphinIcon--generate for big

Then at reset:

dolphinEl.classList.add("dolphinIcon--generate");


Also ensure no code later replaces the HTML with the small class. Search for the Generate dolphin render and confirm it uses dolphinIcon--generate.

D) Make dolphins 25 percent bigger everywhere again, INCLUDING generate dolphin

You are right: increasing icon size can push the Generate tile bigger if padding stays the same.

Agent instructions

File: styles.css

Increase the base dolphin size variable by 25 percent.
If current is 40px, set to 50px.
If current is 32px, set to 40px.

Example:

:root {
  --dolphin-size: 50px;           /* +25% from 40 */
  --dolphin-size-generate: 68px;  /* +25% from 54-ish, adjust from your current */
}


Reduce padding inside the Generate tile so it does not grow.
Find the Generate tile container selector and reduce padding.

Example:

.generateTile {
  padding: 8px;   /* reduce from 12 or 14 */
}


If the dolphin sits inside another inner wrapper, reduce that padding too.

Goal: dolphin grows, tile stays roughly same footprint.

E) Remove halos plan, revert threshold/full gas back to blue

If halos are not showing, it is either the filter was not applied to the right selector, or got overridden.
But you prefer reverting them back to blue anyway.

Agent instructions

Replace the two asset files with the blue versions:

Recreate dolphin-threshold.png and dolphin-fullgas.png by using the same set but without the warm tint.
If you still have the earlier “blue” set, just overwrite those two PNGs in:
public/assets/dolphins/

Delete any halo CSS you tried earlier, or leave it but set to none:

.effortIcon { filter: none; }

One extra important detail

The splash is currently appearing “the moment the set jumps”. That means your scroll/reveal is still tied to the generation completion event.
The fix is to tie scroll to splash visible, not generation completion.

If you want the cleanest test after agent changes, ask them to temporarily add:

console.log("splash shown");
console.log("scroll now");


Then remove after confirming order.
