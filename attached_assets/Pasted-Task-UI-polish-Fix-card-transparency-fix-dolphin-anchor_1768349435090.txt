Task: UI polish. Fix card transparency, fix dolphin anchor, change V to VO, soften active pool buttons. index.js only. No logic refactors.

File: index.js
Edits are in __START_ROUTE_HOME_UI_HTML_R110__ (HTML template) and the CSS block in the same route.

1) Make the main input card more transparent (this is the big missing piece)

Find the main white rounded card wrapper for the input UI. It is the div that wraps the title “Swim Gen”, the slider, pool buttons, and Generate.

It will have a style with a solid background like background:#fff or background: rgba(255,255,255,...).

Change that background to 50% transparent:

Replace whatever it currently is with:

background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5);


Optional but recommended (keeps it readable over the photo):

backdrop-filter: blur(6px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(6px);


Do not change padding, radius, or layout.

2) Fix the dolphin start height and splash position by restoring its original anchor near Generate

Right now #dolphinLoader is sitting near the slider label area, which breaks the animation baseline.

Do this:

A) Remove #dolphinLoader from the pool buttons row completely.

B) Put #dolphinLoader back in the Generate row, immediately after the Generate button, using this exact span:

<span id="dolphinLoader" style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:12px;"></span>


This restores the same baseline the animation expects, so the dolphin starts on the same line as “Generating…” and the splash appears in the consistent location.

3) Change the tiny viewport link from V to VO

Find the small faint link you added (currently “V”) and change its inner text to:

VO


Leave the faint styling as is.

4) Soften the active pool button style (stop the heavy black fill)

Find the CSS rules for the pool buttons selected state. It will be something like:

.poolBtn.active { ... }
or

button[data-pool].active { ... }
or the JS toggles an active class.

Change the active styling to a light tint instead of solid black:

/* Active pool button */
.poolBtn.active,
#poolButtons button.active {
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.08);
  border-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.18);
  color: #111;
}


Do not change sizes, just colours.

Why this will match what you asked for

Card becomes visibly translucent over the background image (your screenshot shows it is still basically opaque right now).

Dolphin animation uses the Generate row again, so start height and splash placement return to how it was.

Viewport link becomes “VO” as requested.

Pool selection is still clear, but not aggressive black.
