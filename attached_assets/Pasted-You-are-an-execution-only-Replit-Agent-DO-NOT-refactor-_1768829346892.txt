DO NOT refactor, redesign, or optimise.
DO NOT change application behaviour except where explicitly instructed.
DO NOT add new features beyond the tasks below.
MAKE ONLY THE CHANGES REQUESTED.

TASK A: GATE THE /viewport-lab ROUTE
Goal: Keep /viewport-lab available for local testing, but disable it in production.

Implement this gating rule:
- If process.env.NODE_ENV equals "production", then /viewport-lab must return HTTP 404.
- Otherwise, it can behave exactly as it does now.

Requirements:
- Do not change the main / route behaviour.
- Do not change what /viewport-lab renders in non production.
- Do not add authentication.
- Do not add new dependencies.

TASK B: ADD A PROPRIETARY LICENSE FILE
Create a new file at repo root named: LICENSE

Contents must clearly indicate proprietary terms, including:
- Copyright (c) 2026 Creative Arts Global LTD
- "All rights reserved."
- Permission is NOT granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, or sell.
- State that no license is granted except by written permission from Creative Arts Global LTD.

Keep it short and plain English. Do not reference MIT, Apache, GPL, or any open source license.

TASK C: ADD A MINIMAL README FILE
Create a new file at repo root named: README.md

Include:
- Project name: Swim Workout Generator
- One sentence description
- Local run instructions (keep generic if unsure): install deps, run start
- A short section: "License" that states: "Copyright (c) 2026 Creative Arts Global LTD. All rights reserved."

Do not include secrets.
Do not include URLs.
Do not include roadmap or marketing.

TASK D: ADD COPYRIGHT NOTICE AT END OF BENEFITS SECTION IN UI SOURCE
Locate the "benefits" section in the source where benefits are rendered.

Add this line after the benefits content:
"© Creative Arts Global LTD. All rights reserved."

Rules:
- Must render once per page or view where benefits are shown.
- Must not duplicate within the same render.
- Must not alter existing benefit items.
- Must not affect calculations, state, or conditional logic.
- Prefer adding at render time, not inside the data list itself.

1) Files changed or created
2) For /viewport-lab gating, show the exact code snippet added or modified
3) For benefits copyright insertion, state the function or component where it was inserted
4) Confirm no other files were modified
