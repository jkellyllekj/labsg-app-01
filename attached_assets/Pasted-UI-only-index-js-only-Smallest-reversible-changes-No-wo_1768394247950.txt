UI only. index.js only. Smallest reversible changes. No workout logic changes.

Edit only these blocks:

ROUTE_HOME_UI_HTML_R110

ROUTE_HOME_UI_JS_RENDER_GLUE_R163 (only if needed for wiring the new header dolphin and bg button)

1) Set white chip transparency to 35 percent

We tested 25 percent and 50 percent. Now set it to 35 percent.

Where the shared white variable is defined, set:

:root {
  --white35: rgba(255,255,255,0.35);
  --whiteBorder: rgba(255,255,255,0.42);
}


Then ensure all white chips and buttons use var(--white35) as their background, including:

Swim Gen chip

Pool buttons

Advanced options chip

1500 chip

Generate box background

Summary capsules

Keep glow rings and shadows unchanged.

2) Fix per set dolphins alignment and spacing

Current is: dolphin above metres. We want:

Dolphin aligned with the set title line (Warm up, Build, Drill)

Metres aligned with the set detail line (the “9x25 …” line), and on the right.

Implementation: in each set card header area, structure it as a 2 row right column:

Row 1: dolphin right aligned, aligned with title
Row 2: metres right aligned, aligned with detail line

Use this CSS:

.setHeaderRow {
  display:flex;
  align-items:flex-start;
  justify-content:space-between;
  gap:12px;
}

.setRightCol {
  display:flex;
  flex-direction:column;
  align-items:flex-end;
  justify-content:flex-start;
  gap:10px; /* creates space between dolphin and metres */
}

.setRightCol .setDolphin {
  font-size:22px;
  line-height:1;
}

.setRightCol .setMeters {
  font-weight:700;
}


Then in the set card HTML, ensure the left column contains both title and detail lines, and the right column is setRightCol with dolphin first then metres second.

Result:

dolphin lines up with “Build”

metres lines up with “5x25 freestyle descend to hard”

3) Add regen dolphin and bg picker next to the workout title chip (Mixed Bag etc.)

You want:

A dolphin next to the workout title (Mixed Bag) on the left, acting as regenerate.

The background picker also present there.

Keep the dolphin next to Swim Gen as a logo, that is fine.

Where the workout title chip is rendered (the yellow “Mixed Bag” chip area), add a small left side control cluster:

regen dolphin button

background button

Layout:

place them immediately to the left of the yellow title chip, aligned vertically center with it.

HTML example:

<div class="workoutTitleRow">
  <button id="regenBtn2" type="button" aria-label="Regenerate" class="iconBtn">🐬</button>
  <button id="bgCycleBtn2" type="button" aria-label="Change background" class="iconBtn">🖼️</button>
  <div id="workoutTitleChip">Mixed Bag</div>
</div>


CSS:

.workoutTitleRow{
  display:flex;
  align-items:center;
  gap:10px;
}

.iconBtn{
  background: transparent;
  border:none;
  padding:0;
  cursor:pointer;
  font-size:22px;
  line-height:1;
  text-shadow: 0 6px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.20);
}


Wiring:

regenBtn2 should trigger the same action as Generate. Use generateBtn.click().

bgCycleBtn2 should call the same background cycle function as the top bg button. Reuse existing handler.

If those functions are not in scope, just dispatch click events to the existing buttons generateBtn and bgCycleBtn.

Example:

document.getElementById("regenBtn2")?.addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.getElementById("generateBtn")?.click();
});

document.getElementById("bgCycleBtn2")?.addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.getElementById("bgCycleBtn")?.click();
});


End.
