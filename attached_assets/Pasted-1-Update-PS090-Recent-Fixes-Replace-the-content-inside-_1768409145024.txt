1) Update PS090 Recent Fixes

Replace the content inside PS090 Recent Fixes with this updated section (or append these new items at the end).

Paste:

Add under 2026-01-14:

Dolphin animation stabilised

Centralised dolphin animation into one helper

Cancels older timers and tokenises runs to avoid overlap

Works on repeated presses and rapid presses

Custom SwimGen dolphin icon set created and adopted

Replaced emoji dolphin with custom dolphin images

Added 6 assets: base plus 5 effort levels

Assets stored under public/assets/dolphins/

CSS extraction started

Moved most inline CSS out into styles.css

Viewport Lab CSS is scoped to avoid bleeding into the main UI

Why this matters: the project-state currently still talks as if the dolphin stabilisation patch is queued, and it does not mention the new dolphin assets or CSS separation.

2) Update PS100 Current Known UI Issues

Replace the content inside PS100 Current Known UI Issues with this updated list, because the issues have moved on.

Paste:

Dolphin and splash animation

Splash appears at the wrong resting angle

Desired: fixed resting angle rotated left about 130 degrees

Splash must never spin

Splash is not visible because scroll or reveal happens too early

Desired: splash becomes visible first, then smooth scroll happens

Dolphin fade out and splash fade in are currently sequential

Desired: crossfade at the same time over 0.2 seconds

Generate dolphin sizing regression

Dolphin sometimes returns to small size after generation

Desired: generate dolphin remains large idle after completion

Effort bar icons

Effort dolphins still read too small on mobile

Increase icon size by another 25 percent

Coffee cup and Z must be legible at small sizes

Threshold and Full Gas dolphins look faded on red backgrounds

Desired for now: revert them to blue and rely on facial expression

Remove warm tint from those two assets

Layout polish parked

Set card dolphin and metres alignment is noted but not urgent yet

Desired: dolphin aligns with set title line

Desired: metres aligns with the set detail line

May be revisited once sets contain longer instructions

This captures what you reported today and replaces older items that are no longer accurate.

3) Update PS120 Next Single Step

PS120 must match what you actually want the next agent to do. Right now it still describes the old dolphin stabilisation patch as the next step. Replace PS120 with this.

Paste:

Next Single Step

Pick one only.

UI only.

Fix splash and icon presentation:

Lock splash to a fixed resting angle rotated left about 130 degrees

Ensure splash never spins

Crossfade dolphin out and splash in at the same time over 0.2 seconds

Delay scroll or reveal so splash is visible before the page moves

Keep generate dolphin large at rest after completion

Effort bar icons: increase size by another 25 percent

Threshold and Full Gas: revert to blue assets with no warm tint

Stop after this single pass and wait for Jess manual testing feedback.

That makes the next move unambiguous.

4) Optional but useful: update PS060 Current System Snapshot

This is optional, but it will prevent confusion for the next agent.

Add one bullet under Routes and tools:

Dolphin assets are served from public/assets/dolphins/ and used across UI and effort bar
