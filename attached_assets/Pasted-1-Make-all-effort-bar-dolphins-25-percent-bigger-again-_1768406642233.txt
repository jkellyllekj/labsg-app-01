1) Make all effort bar dolphins 25 percent bigger again

Right now they are still too small and the coffee and Z are hard to read.

Agent instructions

File: styles.css
Find the rule for the effort bar icons, likely .effortIcon.

Increase width and height by 25 percent.

Example if it is currently 40px:

40 × 1.25 = 50px

So set:

.effortIcon { width: 50px; height: 50px; }


If it is currently 32px, set to 40px.
If it is currently 35px, set to 44px.

Do not change anything else.

2) Set-card dolphins still rotating the wrong way

Generate panel is correct, set cards are not. That means there are two spin implementations:

One uses the global keyframes you flipped

Another uses inline rotate or a different keyframes name for set cards

Agent instructions

File: index.js
Search for any of these:

rotate(360deg)

360deg

spin

dolphinSpin

animationName

keyframes

You will find the set-card animation path. Fix it by flipping only the set-card spin:

Change rotate(360deg) to rotate(-360deg)

Or change to { transform: rotate(360deg) } to rotate(-360deg) if it uses a different keyframes block

Or if it uses animationDirection = "normal", set to "reverse"

Do not touch the generate panel code.

Acceptance check:

Generate dolphin spins correct direction

Set card dolphins now match it

3) Splash angle reset, needs to be rotated left about 130 degrees

You want the splash fixed at roughly -130deg and not drifting back.

Agent instructions

File: index.js
Find the splash show code, where you set splashEl.style.transform.

Set it explicitly to include rotate every time, like:

splashEl.style.transform = "scale(0.75) rotate(-130deg)";
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  splashEl.style.transform = "scale(1) rotate(-130deg)";
});


Also in styles.css ensure splash default includes the rotate too:

.splash {
  transform: scale(0.75) rotate(-130deg);
}


That prevents it snapping back to a default angle.

4) Threshold and Full Gas icons fade into the red backgrounds

Yes, in your screenshot they lose edge definition because the warm tint is close to the background.

The best fix is not redoing them first. It is a UI compositing trick:

Recommendation: subtle white halo, done in CSS

This keeps them readable on any background without changing assets.

Agent instructions

File: styles.css
Add this to the effort bar icons only, not everywhere:

.effortIcon {
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 2px rgba(255,255,255,0.85))
          drop-shadow(0 0 6px rgba(255,255,255,0.35));
}


If that is too strong, reduce the opacities.
This gives a soft edge glow and stops the red bars swallowing the dolphins.

Optional if you want a cleaner outline instead of glow:

.effortIcon {
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.9))
          drop-shadow(1px 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.6))
          drop-shadow(-1px -1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.6));
}


Try the glow version first.
