🛠️ AGENT TASK: Replace Generic Drill Sets with Realistic Drill Descriptions

🎯 Goal

Improve Drill set variety and realism by replacing vague descriptions like "drill choice" and "drill swim" with structured sets using real drills.

These drill sets should reflect what swimmers and coaches actually use — e.g. Fist, Scull, DPS, Catch-up — and follow logical patterns (50s or 25s, grouped by type).

🧠 What to Do

Update Drill set generation logic in buildOneSetBodyShared() (where k.includes("drill")):

Replace or supplement existing generic lines (e.g. "6x50 drill swim", "4x100 drill choice") with named, structured drills.

Use templates like:

6×50 drill (Fist, Catch-up, DPS)
8×25 drill (Scull front, Scull rear)
4×50 (25 drill / 25 swim)


Vary set lengths but keep total drill distance between 4 × poolLength and 8 × poolLength

Effort must always stay in blue, green, or yellow zones (never orange/red)

Drill sets should feel short, precise, and technical

Use these example drills as your base:

Fist

Catch-up

DPS (Distance Per Stroke)

Scull Front / Rear

3-3-3 (Drill with 3 strokes right/left/both)

Long Dog

Single Arm

25 Drill + 25 Swim

Jazz Hands

Torpedo Glide

Finger Drag

Use these terms inside the set body text so each drill card feels instructional.

Effort Handling

These should always output with a blue, green, or yellow dolphin icon (effort level).

Avoid sprint, strong, or threshold tags.

✅ Example Outputs (valid)

6×50 drill (Fist, DPS, Catch-up) ✅

4×50 (25 drill / 25 swim) ✅

8×25 Scull drill (front / rear) ✅

5×50 finger drag + long dog ✅

6×50 freestyle drills (Catch-up, DPS, Single Arm) ✅

🧪 Test Instructions

Generate workouts of:

1000m, 1500m, 2000m

Pool: 25m and 50m

Confirm:

Each Drill section includes real, named drills (no “drill swim” or “drill choice”)

Total drill distance is reasonable (100–400m)

All effort icons for Drill sections are blue, green, or yellow

Generator renders cleanly, no validation or snapping issues
