Task: Swim Gen panel polish. Invert selected button styles, reposition and resize dolphin, and change frosted panel to clear glass. index.js only. Minimal changes.

A) Invert selected styling for pool buttons and Generate button

Find the CSS rules that style the active pool button. It will be one of these patterns:

.poolBtn.active { ... }

#poolButtons button.active { ... }

.isSelected { ... }

Replace the active and default styles with this logic:

Default buttons: clear, normal weight

Active button: white, bold

Paste these rules, adjusted to match your actual selectors:

/* Default pool buttons, unselected */
#poolButtons button,
#poolButtonsRow button {
  background: transparent;
  border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.18);
  color: #111;
  font-weight: 500;
}

/* Selected pool button */
#poolButtons button.active {
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.95);
  border-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.22);
  color: #111;
  font-weight: 800;
}


Now apply the same idea to the Generate button.

Find the Generate button styling and ensure:

Default: clear, normal

While generating or pressed: white and bold

If there is an isGenerating class or disabled state, use that. Add:

#generateBtn {
  background: transparent;
  border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.18);
  color: #111;
  font-weight: 500;
}

#generateBtn.isActive,
#generateBtn:active,
#generateBtn[disabled] {
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.95);
  border-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.22);
  color: #111;
  font-weight: 800;
}


If your JS currently applies active to the selected pool button, keep that. We only change CSS meaning.

B) Dolphin placement and size

Current problem:

Dolphin is tiny

Dolphin is anchored next to Advanced options

It is not already present in the correct area

We want:

Dolphin always visible, larger

Positioned in the empty space under Generate, centred under the Generate button area

Spins only during generating, splashes once at finish

Do this:

In the Swim Gen panel HTML, locate the row containing the pool buttons and Generate button. Immediately after that row, insert a dedicated dolphin spot container:

<div id="dolphinSpot" style="position:relative; height:46px; margin-top:6px;">
  <span id="dolphinLoader" style="position:absolute; right:18px; top:2px; font-size:34px; line-height:1;">🐬</span>
</div>


This keeps the dolphin always on screen and places it in that empty area under Generate. The right:18px can be nudged to visually centre under the Generate button.

Remove the old dolphin span that is currently sitting next to Advanced options, so it does not duplicate.

Keep the spin and splash behaviour, but do not hide the dolphin anymore.

Find the JS that currently does:

set dolphin text

add class dolphinSpin

clear it later

Change behaviour:

Idle state: dolphin shows 🐬 with no spin class

During generating: add spin class

Finish: remove spin class, briefly show 💦, then return to 🐬

Minimal JS behaviour:

On start:

dolphin.textContent = "🐬"

dolphin.classList.add("dolphinSpin")

On finish:

dolphin.classList.remove("dolphinSpin")

dolphin.textContent = "💦"

after 250ms set back to 🐬

Add or keep this CSS:

@keyframes dolphinSpin { from { transform: rotate(0deg); } to { transform: rotate(360deg); } }
.dolphinSpin { display:inline-block; animation: dolphinSpin 700ms linear infinite; }

C) Change the Swim Gen panel from frosted to clear glass

Current problem:

It looks frosted because of blur and a tinted fill

We want:

Clear glass look: fully transparent interior

Visible glass edge and subtle reflection

No blur

Find the main Swim Gen panel wrapper element. It has the background, border, radius, shadow.

Set it to:

background: transparent;

remove blur filters

keep border and add a reflection overlay using a pseudo element

Add this CSS for a class, for example .glassPanel, then apply that class to the Swim Gen wrapper:

.glassPanel {
  background: transparent;
  border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.45);
  border-radius: 22px;
  box-shadow: 0 12px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.18);
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* Reflection highlight */
.glassPanel::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg,
    rgba(255,255,255,0.28) 0%,
    rgba(255,255,255,0.10) 18%,
    rgba(255,255,255,0.00) 45%);
  pointer-events: none;
}


Important:

Remove any backdrop-filter: blur(...) from the Swim Gen panel wrapper.

Do not add padding or outer gutters.

If the wrapper is inline styled, either move to a class or keep inline background as transparent and keep the border. The reflection requires CSS.
