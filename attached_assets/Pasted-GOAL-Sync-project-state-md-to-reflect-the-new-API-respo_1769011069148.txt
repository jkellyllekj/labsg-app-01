GOAL
Sync project-state.md to reflect the new API response fields from /generate-workout.
Do not change any generator logic or UI.
Only edit project-state.md.

FILE TO EDIT
project-state.md

EDIT RULE
This file has no block markers. Do not refactor the whole doc.
Do only the exact text replacements described below.

STEP 1
Open project-state.md.

STEP 2
Find the section headed:
KNOWN LIMITATIONS

It currently contains bullets that say the API returns text only and does not return structured sections or intensity metadata.

Replace ONLY the following block, from the line that starts with:
- API returns text-only workouts (workoutText)
down to and including the line that starts with:
- Future work: return structured section objects alongside text

REPLACE THAT WHOLE BLOCK WITH THIS EXACT TEXT

- API returns workouts with workoutText plus structured metadata
- /generate-workout success response includes:
  - sections: array of { label, dist, body }
  - sectionMeta: array of { zone, isStriated }
  - workoutMeta: { hasRed, redSectionsCount }
- This enables automated detection of:
  - red or full gas frequency
  - label and colour mismatches
  - striation patterns (odds and evens, descend, build)

STEP 3
Find the section headed:
TESTING / TOOLING

Locate the line that currently says:
- Suite C: intensity detection (skipped)
and the line in latest results that says:
- Suite C: SKIPPED (text-only API)

Replace those TWO lines only, as follows.

Replace:
- Suite C: intensity detection (skipped)
With:
- Suite C: intensity detection (enabled)

Replace:
- Suite C: SKIPPED (text-only API)
With:
- Suite C: TODO (enable assertions for sections, sectionMeta, workoutMeta)

STEP 4
Find the section headed:
NEXT SINGLE STEP (ACTIVE)

It currently contains:
- (Completed) Enforce exact target totals for slider distance

Replace ONLY that single line with:

- Enable Suite C assertions for metadata contract and red presence tracking

STEP 5
Save the file.

STEP 6
Commit with this exact message:

docs(project-state): record structured intensity metadata and unblock Suite C

STOP
Do not edit index.js.
Do not add new ideas.
Do not change any other parts of project-state.md.
