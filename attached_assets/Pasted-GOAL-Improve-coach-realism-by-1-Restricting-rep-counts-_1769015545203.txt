GOAL
Improve coach realism by:
1) Restricting rep counts so oddball counts like 11, 14, 17, 18, 19 do not appear.
2) Increasing full gas injection frequency so red appears more often.

FILE TO EDIT
index.js

SCOPE
Only make two small edits:
- Update isAllowedRepCount
- Update the probability threshold in injectOneFullGas
Do not change UI or CSS.
Do not refactor.

STEP 1
Open index.js.

STEP 2
Find this function:
function isAllowedRepCount(repCount, repDistance) {

Inside it, locate the block:

  // Single rep is always allowed
  if (r === 1) return true;

  // Allow any rep count 2-20 for flexibility with odd pools
  // This prevents drift when templates don't match exactly
  if (r >= 2 && r <= 20) return true;

  return false;

Replace ONLY that whole block with this exact block:

  // Single rep is always allowed
  if (r === 1) return true;

  // Coach-plausible rep counts only.
  // Reject oddball counts that feel mathy, not coach-written.
  const allowed = new Set([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 20]);

  // 9 is allowed mainly to permit common shapes like 9x50 and 9x100.
  return allowed.has(r);

STEP 3
Find this function:
function injectOneFullGas(sections, seed) {

Inside it, locate this existing line and comment:

  // 30% probability for less frequent red cards (was 50%)
  if (mulberry32(seed >>> 0)() >= 0.3) return sections;

Replace ONLY those two lines with these exact two lines:

  // 60% probability to ensure red appears regularly in realistic workouts
  if (mulberry32(seed >>> 0)() >= 0.6) return sections;

STEP 4
Save the file.

STEP 5
Manual test in browser (25m, 2600):
Generate 15 times and confirm you do NOT see any of these patterns anywhere:
11x50
14x25
17x100
18x25
19x100

Also confirm you see sprint or full gas style efforts in Main more often than before.

STEP 6
Commit with this exact message:

fix(realism): restrict rep counts and increase full gas frequency

STOP
Do not change any other code.
