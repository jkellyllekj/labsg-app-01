Goal

Do not scroll or reveal the generated workout until after the splash has appeared. If needed, slightly speed up the loop so the splash happens sooner.

Where to edit

In index.js, find the dolphin animation helper you added earlier. It will have:

a “start run” function

some timeouts for loop completion

a “finish” phase that shows splash and then resets to dolphin

Also find where the code currently:

scrolls to the generated section (scrollIntoView, window.scrollTo, etc), OR

reveals/unhides the generated section (changing display, opacity, max-height, adding a class, etc)

Change 1: move the scroll/reveal to after splash is visible

You must ensure the ordering is:

dolphin loop finishes

dolphin fades out (0.2s)

splash fades in + grows (0.2s)

only now: scroll/reveal generated workout

hold splash (1.0s)

splash fades out (0.2s)

dolphin fades back in (0.2s)

Implementation: add a callback that runs right after splash is made visible.

Do this pattern (minimal)

Inside the dolphin helper, in the timeout where you set splash opacity to 1, immediately call a callback:

// inside dolphin helper, at the moment splash appears
splashEl.style.opacity = "1";
splashEl.style.transform = "scale(1.12) rotate(-135deg)";

// NEW: trigger scroll/reveal here
if (typeof onSplashShown === "function") onSplashShown();


Then, wherever you start the animation for Generate, pass onSplashShown and remove any earlier scroll/reveal calls.

Example call site:

runDolphinAnimation({
  dolphinEl,
  splashEl,
  onSplashShown: () => {
    // move the scroll/reveal here
    revealGeneratedWorkout();
    scrollGeneratedIntoViewSmooth();
  }
});


If the current code does not use an options object, do the smallest equivalent: set a global pendingScrollAfterSplash = true and consume it when splash appears. But callback is cleaner and still small.

Change 2: If it still feels slow, speed up only the loop duration

Find the dolphin loop duration constant or the timeout that represents “one full loop”.

Reduce it slightly, do not touch other timings:

loop duration: reduce by 15 to 25 percent

Example:

if it is 1200ms, try 950ms

if it is 1000ms, try 800ms

Do not change:

fade out 0.2

splash fade in 0.2

hold 1.0

splash fade out 0.2

dolphin fade in 0.2
