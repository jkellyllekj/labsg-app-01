TASK 1: SECRET AND CREDENTIAL SCAN
Search the entire repository for hardcoded secrets or sensitive values.

Search patterns must include, but are not limited to:
- sk-
- api_key
- apikey
- secret
- token
- password
- auth
- bearer
- BEGIN PRIVATE KEY
- private_key
- client_secret
- service_role
- webhook
- .env

For each match, record:
- file path
- line number
- matched text (redact if clearly a real secret)

Classify each finding as one of:
- false_positive
- real_secret
- unclear_needs_human_review

Do not modify any files.

TASK 2: ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE HYGIENE
Verify the following:
- Whether a .env file exists
- Whether .env is listed in .gitignore
- Whether example env files contain real secrets
- Whether config files reference environment variables instead of literals

Report:
- Any files and line numbers where secrets are hardcoded
- Any missing .gitignore protections

Do not modify any files.

TASK 3: PUBLIC EXPOSURE REVIEW
Identify and report:
- Deployment scripts
- Admin or debug routes
- Feature flags
- Paid or premium logic
- Any endpoints or logic that should be reviewed before public exposure

Do not remove or change anything.
Only report what exists.

TASK 4: LICENSE AND README CHECK
Verify:
- Whether a LICENSE file exists
- Whether README contains secrets, private URLs, or unintended promises

If LICENSE is missing:
- Report this
- Do not add one
