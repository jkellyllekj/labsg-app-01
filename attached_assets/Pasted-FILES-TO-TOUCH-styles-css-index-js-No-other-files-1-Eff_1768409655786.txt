FILES TO TOUCH


styles.css


index.js


No other files.

1. Effort bar icons (styles.css)
Goal


Increase size by another 25%.


Remove all filters, opacity, or inherited tint.


Ensure assets render pure blue everywhere.


Edit
Locate the .effortIcon rule and replace it fully.
.effortIcon {
  width: 62px;           /* +25% from 50px */
  height: 62px;
  object-fit: contain;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
  filter: none !important;
  opacity: 1 !important;
}

Do not add new classes.
Do not add media queries yet.
This alone should make the coffee cup and Z legible.

2. Lock splash rotation angle and prevent spin (styles.css)
Goal


Splash has a fixed resting angle.


Never spins.


Never inherits animation transforms.


Add a dedicated class once.
.splashFixed {
  transform: rotate(-130deg);
  animation: none !important;
  will-change: opacity;
}


3. Crossfade dolphin ↔ splash simultaneously (index.js)
Goal


Dolphin fades out and splash fades in at the same time.


Duration ~200ms.


No waiting for one to finish.


Change
Find the helper that handles generate animation (the same one you stabilised recently).
Where you currently have logic equivalent to:


dolphin fade out


then splash show


then scroll


Replace the timing only, not structure:
Conceptual instruction (not a refactor):


Apply opacity: 0 to dolphin


Apply opacity: 1 to splash


Do both in the same tick


Use transition: opacity 200ms ease


If there is a setTimeout separating them, remove the separation and apply both state changes together.

4. Ensure splash is visible before scroll (index.js)
Goal


Splash is seen.


Scroll happens after visibility, not before.


Minimal fix


Delay scroll by 150–200ms after splash opacity is set to 1.


Do not change scroll logic itself. Only the delay.

5. Apply fixed rotation to generate splash (index.js)
When the splash element is created or selected:


Add the splashFixed class.


Do not animate rotation.


Do not reuse any spin class.



6. Keep generate dolphin large after completion (index.js)
Goal


Once generation finishes, dolphin remains in its large idle size.


Fix


Ensure the class dolphinIcon--generate is not removed at the end of the animation cleanup.


Cleanup should remove spin or fade classes only.



What NOT to touch


No background code.


No set layout.


No new assets.


No refactors.


No project-state edits.



Definition of done (manual test checklist)
Jess to confirm after Agent runs:


Effort bar dolphins are visibly larger and crisp.


Threshold and Full Gas are blue, not faded.


Splash rests angled left ~130° and never spins.


Dolphin and splash crossfade together.


Splash is visible before scroll.


Generate dolphin stays large when idle.


If any one of these fails, stop and report. Do not “fix forward”.

Next action
You can now paste the Agent execution instruction:

Read PROJECT_STATE.md and WORKING-METHOD-REPLIT.md.
Current task: Fix splash and icon presentation only.
Files to touch: styles.css, index.js.
Proceed with the bounded changes exactly as specified.

I will wait for your manual test feedback before proposing anything else.Sources
